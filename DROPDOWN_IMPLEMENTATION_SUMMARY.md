# Dropdown Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully moved difficulty level and question count selection from SettingsScreen to RangeSelectionScreen, implementing them as Unity TMP_Dropdown components.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Components Created
- **DifficultyDropdown.cs**: Dropdown component for difficulty level selection (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **QuestionCountDropdown.cs**: Dropdown component for question count selection (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)

### 2. SettingsScreen Modifications
- Removed `DifficultySelector` and `QuestionCountSelector` references
- Removed related event handlers and logic
- Now focused only on audio settings (sound/music toggles)
- Simplified code structure and removed dependency on game settings management

### 3. RangeSelectionScreen Enhancements
- Added `DifficultyDropdown` and `QuestionCountDropdown` components
- Integrated dropdown initialization with global settings
- Added automatic global settings synchronization when dropdown values change
- Enhanced with proper event handling and cleanup
- Added automatic range buttons recreation when difficulty changes

## Technical Implementation Details

### DifficultyDropdown Features
- Three difficulty options: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Automatic mapping between dropdown indices and DifficultyLevel enum
- Event-driven architecture with OnDifficultyChanged event
- Proper cleanup and memory management

### QuestionCountDropdown Features
- Configurable question count options (default: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
- Flexible options system allowing runtime configuration
- Automatic mapping between indices and question counts
- Event-driven architecture with OnQuestionCountChanged event

### RangeSelectionScreen Integration
- **Global Settings Sync**: Automatically loads and saves to GlobalSettingsManager
- **Dynamic Range Updates**: Range buttons are recreated when difficulty changes
- **Proper Event Management**: All events are properly subscribed/unsubscribed
- **Error Handling**: Defensive programming with null checks

## Benefits of New Implementation

1. **Better UX**: Dropdown components provide cleaner, more compact interface
2. **Centralized Settings**: All game setup now happens in one screen (RangeSelectionScreen)
3. **Simplified Settings**: SettingsScreen now focuses only on audio settings
4. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between components
5. **Global Settings Integration**: Seamless integration with existing settings system

## Files Modified
- `Assets/Scripts/MathGame/Screens/SettingsScreen.cs` - Simplified, removed game settings
- `Assets/Scripts/MathGame/Screens/RangeSelectionScreen.cs` - Enhanced with dropdowns

## Files Created
- `Assets/Scripts/MathGame/UI/DifficultyDropdown.cs` - New difficulty dropdown component
- `Assets/Scripts/MathGame/UI/QuestionCountDropdown.cs` - New question count dropdown component
- Associated .meta files for Unity recognition

## Next Steps
1. Update Unity scenes to include the new dropdown components in UI hierarchy
2. Configure prefabs to reference the new dropdown components
3. Test the integration in Unity Editor
4. Verify that settings are properly saved and loaded across game sessions
